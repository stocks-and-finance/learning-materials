## Financial Goal Planning

It is imperative that each and every person has set a proper financial goal. What will happen when we retire and we do not have enough money in hand? What if we are forced to work till we can possibly work? All these are difficult questions to answer and slightly horrifying in a way. 

In the modern world, people will basically have financial goals similar to the below points.

- Financial planning for retirement corpus.
- Planning for buying a house.
- Planning for kids education.
- Planning for buying a car.

etc.,

Most of the goals are dependant on the following factors,

- Time period for achieving it.
- Investment instrument being used i.e equity, debt etc.,
- Your ability to allocate part of your income for investing.

Ideally, people resort to a 14-15% CAGR assumption and use a 60-40 equity to debt allocation. 

The important takeaway is that you identify your goals and then do a goal planning. Kuvera has the feature which will help you plan it. It even takes LTCG and inflation into consideration.
