Increasing Income
-----------------

Everyone has their own capacity of increasing their income, but the absolute minimum in which income should be raised is to atlease keep up with inflation. This can be split across years, i.e if you get a 30% raise and do not get a hike for the next three years, then it is still ok since the hike can be split across 3 years i.e 10% a year. But this does not usually happen since no hike means a lot of other worrying things might be there.
