### Emergency Funds

Before we venture out to any investment such as equity, real estate, gold etc., we need to build a solid emergency fund. Regardless of what job we work on, what our monthly salary is, what is our net worth and so on. 

### What is the need for it

The need for an emergency fund stems from the fact that there is a real emergency happening

- If you are a salaried person then what if you get fired from your job and how will you manage your finances until you get a new one?
- If you own a business, what if the business is in such a loss and it will not be able to provide for your monthly expenses?

and so on. You should get the idea by now.

### How much should we save

Now we have sufficient evidence that we need an emergency fund, the next question that comes is how much do we need? 

Monthly expense is just one part, there are other emergencies as well but of course we need not get to the point where only the paranoid survive. There is no straight answer to this question since personal finance is personal, but the general rule is to have atleast 

- Cash in had for immediate emergencies (50K should be sufficient enough to push for house expenses i.e the bare minimal for around 4-5 months)
- Six months of expenses (This again, varies from person to person). This expenses should also include any critical EMIs that you would be paying.
- A decent medical emergency fund (5 Lakhs should be sufficient for India, considering average hospitalization charges. This is regardless of whether you have a health insurance or not. Not everything comes under health insurance and not all health insurance immediately disburses funds for treatment immediately. Insurance exist for planned/bigger expense such as Operations and such).
- Another basket for miscellaneous emergency (This is optional, but just in case if you find any other important need)

The first two is absolutely necessary.

### Where should we save it

Now we have the quantum we need to save, next question is where do we store/save the money in? For that, we have to understand a couple of things first. Any financial instrument is defined by the below things.

- Liquidity
- Capital protection/Risk factors
- Returns
- Taxation

For emergency funds, liquidity and capital protection are probably the most important ones.

### Returns

Returns from an emergency fund should be to the level that they atleast keep up with inflation so that there is no erosion of capital. Anything more will require to take us more risk.

### The Importance of liquidity

Equity, Real estate (debatable) and other investment instruments are long term income/capital generating financial instruments. They cannot be regarded or considered as emergency funds simply due to the fact that we will not be able to liquidate it in time. Consider the fact that during an emergency such as 2008 recession, pandemics (such as COVID-19), 

- Markets will be down, so you won't be able to exit out (unless you want massive capital loss)
- You wont be able to sell your land/assets because there is no liquidity in the market and nobody will have cash for it. Even if they do then they will bargain for lower price since you don't have money.

So liquidity is perhaps the top most requirement for having an emergency fund.

### Capital protection/Risk factors

Capital protection is perhaps very important. Now the emergency funds should not degrade in value the moment we start to invest in it and should be ready for withdrawal, which means returns after some investment horizon i.e after 2 years it will be profitable is ruled out. Let's explore what and all funds we do have,

- Fixed Deposits
- Debt funds
  - Overnight mutual funds
  - Liquid funds
  - Other funds like money market funds, bonds with duration more than 90 days etc.,
- Gold

etc.,

When you are considering banks, it is important to consider the recent fiasco that happened (PMC bank, Co op banks, Yes bank) where your capital might be locked down. Two things we need to consider,

- The deposit insurance keeps changing in every budget. Although it is unlikely that they will touch this again, it is under the mercy of the government. 
- Considering the above fact, stick to the RBI big three list i.e HDFC, ICICI and SBI. These banks have been categorized by RBI as systematically important banks so they will be bailed out in case of a crisis.

COVID-19 has taught us that anything above liquid funds in risk ratio (even money market funds) can crash. Gold returns are erratic and can sometimes [give zero or even negative returns on capital](https://freefincal.com/do-not-expect-returns-from-your-gold-investments-do-this-instead/). Even in liquid funds, stick to the ones that ones that invest only in govt bonds i.e bonds such as Parag parikh liquid fund and Quantum liquid fund. Liquidity is another reason why we cannot invest in govt bonds directly since you cannot exit them and there is not much liquidity in the secondary market where you can sell these.

Another thing is that, extreme emergencies such as wartime emergency has shown us that stock markets can be closed for short periods. So it is wise to save around 25% of emergency funds outside of the stock markets such as fixed deposits.

### Taxation

This isn't really a thing to worry about. But having 75% of emergency funds in debt mutual funds have LTCG benefits.

### Conclusion

- Use your own prudence to define how much money you would need for emergency. 
- Split it across debt mutual funds (75%) and fixed deposits(25%).
- Invest only in either of the big three banks for FD.
- Use only overnight funds or liquid funds that invest only in govt bonds.
