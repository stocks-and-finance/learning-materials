### Emergency Funds

Before we venture out to any investment such as equity, real estate, gold etc., we need to build a solid emergency fund. Regardless of what job we work on, what our monthly salary is, what is our net worth and so on. 

### What is the need for it

The need for an emergency fund stems from the fact that there is a real emergency happening

- If you are a salaried person then what if you get fired from your job and how will you manage your finances until you get a new one?
- If you own a business, what if the business is in such a loss and it will not be able to provide for your monthly expenses?

and so on. You should get the idea by now.

### How much should we save

Now we have sufficient evidence that we need an emergency fund, the next question that comes is how much do we need? 

Monthly expense is just one part, there are other emergencies as well but of course we need not get to the point where only the paranoid survive. There is no straight answer to this question since personal finance is personal, but the general rule is to have atleast 

- Six months of expenses 
- A decent medical emergency fund (I arrived at about 5 Lakhs for India) 
- Another basket for miscellaneous emergency (This is optional, but just in case if you find any other important need)

The first two is absolutely necessary.

### Where should we save it

Now we have the quantum we need to save, next question is where do we store/save the money in? For that, we have to understand a couple of things first. Any financial instrument is defined by the below things.

- Liquidity
- Capital protection/Risk factors
- Taxation
- Returns

For emergency funds, liquidity and capital protection are probably the most important ones.

### The Importance of liquidity

Equity, Real estate (debatable) and other investment instruments are long term income/capital generating financial instruments. They cannot be regarded or considered as emergency funds simply due to the fact that we will not be able to liquidate it in time. Consider the fact that during an emergency such as 2008 recession, pandemics (such as COVID-19), 

- Markets will be down, so you won't be able to exit out (unless you want massive capital loss)
- You wont be able to sell your land/assets because there is no liquidity in the market and nobody will have cash for it. Even if they do then they will bargain for lower price since you don't have money.

So liquidity is perhaps the top most requirement for having an emergency fund.

### Capital protection/Risk factors

Capital protection is perhaps very important. Now the emergency funds should not degrade in value
